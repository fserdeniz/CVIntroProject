## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of computer vision techniques using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization tasks. The project uses Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cvintroproject
   ```
   
## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cvintroproject.ipynb
   ```
- Follow the cells step-by-step for understanding the code and outputs.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the input data for training.
- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model for a specific computer vision task.
- **Evaluation:** Analyze model performance using metrics and visualizations.
- **Deployment:** Export the trained model for real-world usage (e.g., ONNX format).
